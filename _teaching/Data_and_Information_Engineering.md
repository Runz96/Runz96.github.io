<b>Overview</b>
* This course provides an introduction to a fundamental aspect of data science and engineering - working with data. Learn skills to efficiently and effectively obtain, manipulate, store, and analyze data (i.e., convert data to information) to support decision making and future data modeling (e.g., regression, data mining, machine learning) efforts. Emphasis on obtaining, cleaning, combining, and wrangling the data into a more usable form. Learn how to break up a large data set into manageable pieces and then use a variety of quantitative and visual tools to summarize and extract information from it. The challenges of big data (e.g., size, streaming data, mixed variable types) will be addressed throughout the course. As an introductory course, the focus will be on understanding basic concepts and how to implement them in R, a leading data science language.
