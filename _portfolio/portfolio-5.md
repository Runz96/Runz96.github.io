* Proposed the first computational framework for modeling rhythms of human behaviors from multimodal sensor signals, including three main components: mobile sensor data processing, rhythm discovery & modeling, and machine learning prediction of health and wellbeing outcomes. The framework achieved the best performance in predicting depression and productivity.
