* Developed a human mobility simulator based on hidden Markov models and OpenStreetMap to simulate the human mobility GPS data. 
* Proposed a novel temporal frequent-pattern tree (TFPT) time series forecasting model to predict future movement based on usersâ€™ historical GPS data. The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
